This is our whatsapp server.
The server side was written in JavaScript with nodeJS.
When accessing its home page, the server sends the client-side code that was written in react.
the server has an api that allows to create an account, creating chats, sending messages and getting information about them.
Note that all suck operations (except creating an account) require a jwt token that is generated by the combination of username and password.
Also, when closing the server, the data won't go away because it is saved in mongo-db.
how to run:
 1. cd {project directory}
 2. npm install (to download the node_moduls)
 3. node server.js
the server runs at port 5000
