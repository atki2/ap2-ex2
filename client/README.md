This is our first whatsapp app using react.
This app has no server so all the data goes away after refresh.
the app has login page, register page and chats page with logic and working buttons.
how to run:
  cd {project directory}
  npm start
note that you need to add the node_moudles directory to the project, get it by installing NodeJS and running the command: "npm install".
